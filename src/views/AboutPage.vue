    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I believe in the power of curiosity and the thrill of creating something out of nothing.
      Web development is my playground where creativity meets problem-solving.
      Every day, I strive to build meaningful and accessible digital experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, I've grown my expertise in front-end and WordPress development.
      From building Vue 3 applications to designing custom WordPress themes, I aim to create fast, SEO-friendly, and
      inclusive websites.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I’m not coding, I’m experimenting with new technologies like headless WordPress using React or conducting
      accessibility audits to improve web usability for everyone.
